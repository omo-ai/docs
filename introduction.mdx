Omo is an open-source, AI-native search and chat platform with your company data.
You can chat with data sources such as Google Drive, Notion, Confluence, and more.

Our goal is to be cloud-agnostic, LLM-agnostic, and vector-store agnostic,
platform for AI based search and chat.  We initially support AWS, Pinecone,
and GPT. We will eventually add support for other clouds
and a broader array of chat and embedding models.

We always welcome new contributors!

Omo is licensed under Apache 2.0.

<Info>
Fun fact: our name is inspired by *Omoikane*, the Japanese god of wisdom and intelligence,
who is able to combine the knowledge of many people.
