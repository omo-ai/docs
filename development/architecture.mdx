## Technologies

Omo was built with the following technologies.

* NextJS
* FastAPI
* Redis
* Celery
* PostgresQL
* AWS
* Pinecone vector store
* GPT-4o
* AuthJS

Although one of our goals is to be cloud-agnostic, LLM-agnostic, and vector-store agnostic,
we initially support AWS, Pinecone, and GPT. We will eventually add support for other clouds
and a broader array of chat and embedding models.
