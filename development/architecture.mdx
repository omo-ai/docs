## Technologies

Omo was built with the following technologies.

* NextJS for the UI
* AuthJS for authentication
* FastAPI for the backend
* Celery for long running tasks
* Redis for the Celery broker
* PostgresQL for the database
* AWS for the cloud infrastructure
* Pinecone for the vector store
* OpenAPI for the embedding and chat models

Although one of our goals is to be cloud-agnostic, LLM-agnostic, and vector-store agnostic,
we initially support AWS, Pinecone, and GPT. We will eventually add support for other clouds
and a broader array of chat and embedding models. We welcome contributors!
