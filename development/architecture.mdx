## Technologies

Omo was built with the following technologies.

* NextJS
* FastAPI
* Redis
* Celery
* PostgresQL
* AWS
* Pinecone vector store
* GPT-4o

Although one of our goals is to be cloud-agnostic and vector-store agnostic,
we initially targeted AWS and Pinecone. We would eventually like to support
GCP, Azure, and other vector stores.
