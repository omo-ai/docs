## Setup your local environment

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:omo-ai/omo.git
```

2. Configure the environment variables

All environment variables are stored in the `envs/` directory. 
After cloning the repo, copy the environment variables templates:

```
cp envs/env.template envs/.env.development
```

3. Generate an encryption key and add it to `.env.development`

Some columns in the database are encrypted. Generate an encryption key
and set the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable with this value. 

To generate a key, on *nix machines:

```sh
echo "ENCRYPTION_KEY=`dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | openssl base64`" >> envs/.env.development
```
<Warning>Don't lose this key or commit to a repo. Doing so will mean you can no longer
decrypt values, and if anyone else gains access to it they can decrypt values.</Warning>

<Info>There are utilities to use AWS secrets manager instead of the database.</Info>

4. Starting the UI and API

Use docker compose to start the environment locally:

```sh
ENV=dev ENV_NS=example docker compose up
```

The `ENV_NS` is an optional variable. If specified, it should reference a folder name under `envs/`. For example, `ENV_NS=example` will include additional environment variabes under `envs/example/.env` in addition to `.env.development` in the project root. 

It's helpful if you want to test different values of environment variables without constantly
changing the value.

For example, if you want to test different values for 2 teams, you can create `envs/team1/.env` and `envs/team2/.env`, then set `ENV_NS=team1` or `ENV_NS=team2`.

You can check the `env_file` attribute in `docker-compose.yaml` to see how `ENV_NS` is used.
